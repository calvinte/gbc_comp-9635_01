	<p>My goal is to become a Web Developer who's also a JavaScript Guru which is why I'm taking these courses at George Brown.  I'm actively looking for work right now in this field.</p>  
	<p>In another life I would be Animal from the Muppets.  He's passionate about his craft and not afraid to be himself.  And he's fluffy.</p>
