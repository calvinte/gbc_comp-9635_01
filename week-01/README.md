Week 1
======

Welcome to Using Web APIs with JSON (COMP 9635).

:)

In this course we’re going to teach you to use APIs (application programming
interfaces) to access third-party services like Google Maps and Instagram. If
that dosen't make sense, don't worry: I'll show you.

The first step toward this will be learning how to use git. We’re going to use
git to manage our code, as a group. What you’re looking at now is actually a
git repository, pretty cool, eh?

**Deliverables for Week 1:**  

1. Fork this repository to your own Github account.
2. Add a folder `lastname-firstname` in the `week-01` folder.
3. Create a `index.html` file in this folder, with a short biography.
4. Submit a pull-request back to the parent repository.
