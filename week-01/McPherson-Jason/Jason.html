		<p> Hey everyone Its me Jason and I am here at GBC on my first day in the course
		Using API's in JSON. The class seems pretty cool so far and I hope to learn a lot during my time here in this 
		class  </p>
		
		<p> I am taking this class in hopes of completing the Web Development Certificate being offered here at GBC. I took a 
		JavaScript course last semester here at the college which I found somewhat challenging, but nonetheless, I did
		learn a lot. The final project required the class to use an API from a web service and extract certain from that API
		and present as a JSON. I had a little difficulty with the final project as I felt I was not very confident with extracting
		and presenting the data. I hope that this course will teach to fluently extract and present data with API's in to JSON </p>
